This code is developed by Jun-Yan Chen (2022). 
This code contain two parts:
 1. Using GPS to the SAR line of sight velocity with second order polynomial plane.
 2. Least square velocity inversion of Los to east-west and up-dip component. 
 
First, you need to have a GPS data and file columes should in the order: 
    station_name, lon, lat, N vel, E vel, Z vel


package needed: 
1. gmt
2. python3

### Step 1: Extract LoS-velocity at each GPS station
First, using GMT to sample the SAR LoS-velocioty at each GPS station.
`awk -F, "{print $2,$3,$4,$5,$6}" GPSFILE | gmt grdtrack -G$SBAS1 -T0.01 > LosSampled`

### Step 2: plane fitting with GPS value
`python GPSCorrection.py SARIMG LosSampled incident_angle azimuth_angle -m False -o CorrectSAR`


### Step 3: Least square inversion
After processing both ascending and descending image:
In the previous will generate CorrectSAR_deramp.nc 
`python rdr2geo.py IMG1 inc1 az1 IMG2 inc2 az2 --gps GPSFILE`
